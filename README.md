# MarkdownDeep - RGregg Fork

This is a fork of the MarkdownDeep OSS project created by TopTenSoftware. 
As of March 2016, that repoistory appears to be no longer maintained. This is an
attempt to update the markdown parser to better handle GitHub Flavored Markdown
in support of the [Markdown-Scanner](https://github.com/onedrive/markdown-scanner) project.

## Goals

1. Support GFM more completely than the previous library
2. Increase code quality and comments to improve maintainability of this library


This project is maintained by [rgregg](https://github.com/rgregg).
